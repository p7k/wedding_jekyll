  Enough about us!

  The biggest thing on our wish list is the chance to celebrate together with
  family and friends! Gifts are not required, but if you would like to send one,
  we have a couple of suggestions:

    Consider a donation to Plan International, an organization dedicated to
    improving the lives of vulnerable children in developing countries. Young
    women in the developing world are more likely to be forced into an early
    marriage, be subjected to violence, be sold into the sex trade, or become
    infected with HIV. Often, girls face discrimination in their own homes. In
    many cases, they have limited access to a doctor or even a primary education
    (if they're able to go to school at all). Plan's Because I am a Girl campaign
    is dedicated to empowering young women in these situations by supplying them
    with basic human rights such as food, healthcare, security and education. We
    encourage you to investigate the website, and If you are interested in
    donating to this cause you can make a check out to "Plan International" and
    mail it to Lillian Dunlap at the below address. We are happy to handle final
    donations so that you can avoid being added to any unwanted mailing lists.

    Help fund the honeymoon. As many of your know, we're big travel lovers! We
    haven't chosen a honeymoon destination yet, simply because there are too many
    great places to choose from. We may go snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef, or
    try a Safari in South Africa or Tanzania, or take a train trip through Europe!
    If you'd like to help us get to our destination, you can mail a check to Lillian
    or Danny at the above address.
