  Fall Garden...  Essentially, wear whatever you'd like.
  If you really aim to please, choose vintage fashion of from 1940's-1980s.
  Fall colors are encouraged. Gentlemen, here is your chance to dig out the brown suit.
</p>
<p class="copy">
  As for practical concerns, Ceremony, cocktail hour and dinner will be outdoors,
  and there is a bit of an incline getting from one to the other. Ladies might be
  more comfortable in flats or wedges rather than a pointy heel.  Also, the bay
  area tends to get chilly as the sun goes down, so a sweater or light jacket is
  a good idea for the evening. (Floridians, feel free to consult with the bride
  for weather wardrobe advice.) We have an indoor space for dancing and revelry
  as well.
